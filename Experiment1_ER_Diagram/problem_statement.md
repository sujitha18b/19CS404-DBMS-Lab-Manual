# Experiment 1: Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram

## 🎯 Objective:
To understand and apply the concepts of ER modeling by creating an ER diagram for a real-world application.

## 📚 Purpose:
The purpose of this workshop is to gain hands-on experience in designing ER diagrams that visually represent the structure of a database including entities, relationships, attributes, and constraints.

## 🧪 Choose One Scenario:

### 🔹 Scenario 1: University Database
Design a database to manage students, instructors, programs, courses, and student enrollments. Include prerequisites for courses.

**User Requirements:**
- Academic programs grouped under departments.
- Students have admission number, name, DOB, contact info.
- Instructors with staff number, contact info, etc.
- Courses have number, name, credits.
- Track course enrollments by students and enrollment date.
- Add support for prerequisites (some courses require others).

---

### 🔹 Scenario 2: Hospital Database
Design a database for patient management, appointments, medical records, and billing.

**User Requirements:**
- Patient details including contact and insurance.
- Doctors and their departments, contact info, specialization.
- Appointments with reason, time, patient-doctor link.
- Medical records with treatments, diagnosis, test results.
- Billing and payment details for each appointment.

---

## 📝 Tasks:
1. Identify entities, relationships, and attributes.
2. Draw the ER diagram using any tool (draw.io, dbdiagram.io, hand-drawn and scanned).
3. Include:
   - Cardinality & participation constraints
   - Prerequisites for University OR Billing for Hospital
4. Explain:
   - Why you chose the entities and relationships.
   - How you modeled prerequisites or billing.

## Entities and Attributes:

-  Patient: Name, Phone Number, Address, Insurance Company
-  Doctor: Name, Hospital ID, Specialization, Department
-  Nurse: Name, Hospital ID.
-  Receptionist: Entry & Exit Time
-  Pharmacy: Medicine Name, Medicine Type, DOM, DOE
-  Rooms: RNO, Floor
-  Records: Record No, Date


## Relationships and Constraints:
-  Allocated To between Patient and Rooms
   -  Cardinality: One-to-One
   -  Participation: Total on patient
-  Consults between Patient and Doctor
   -  Cardinality: Many-to-Many
   -  Participation: Partia
-  Guides between Nurse and Patient  
   -  Cardinality: One-to-Many
   -  participation: Partial
-  Instructs between Doctor and Nurse
   -  Cardinality: One-to-Many
   -  Participation: Partial
-  Maintains between Receptionist and Records
   -  Cardinality: One-to-Many
   -  Participation: Total on records
-  Purchase Medicines between Patient and Pharmacy
   -  Cardinality: One-to-Many
   -  Participation: Partial

## Extension (Billing):

The billing aspect is indirectly modeled through the "Purchase Medicines" relationship between the Patient and Pharmacy, where details such as DOM (Date of Manufacture) and DOE (Date of Expiry) are tracked. This implies billing and inventory tracking. Additionally, doctor consultations and room allocations are billable services implicitly modeled in the relationships.



## Design Choices:

Entities were selected based on real-world hospital workflow components: patients, rooms, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and receptionists. Relationships like consults, guides, instructs, and allocated to reflect real interactions and responsibilities.
Billing was incorporated through the pharmacy-patient connection and service interactions. Cardinality and participation were based on logical constraints (e.g., a patient is allocated one room, but a doctor can consult many patients).

## RESULT

Successfully completed the ER diagram for the hospital database scenario, including all necessary entities, relationships, attributes, constraints, and billing logic as required.
